- Use new xdt macros, this requires xfce-dev-tools 4.7.2.
- New tests for object bindings.

  zh_CN, ur, ur_PK, da, eu, pt.

- Don't translate "true" and "false" in the xfconf-query output.
- Updated translations (cs, da, fi, fr, nl, pt_BR, sv, zh_CN)


4.5.93
======
- Install xfconfd to $(libexecdir) instead of $(bindir).
- Fix perl bindings link order on Cygwin (bug 4735).
- Allow passing arbitrary options to the perl bindings' Makefile.PL
  generation script (bug 4735).

  Daniel Nylander (sv), Terje Uriansrud (nb), Carles Muñoz Gorriz (ca),
  Abel Martín (es), Maximilian Schleiss (fr), Og Maciel (pt_BR),
  Eren Turkay (tr)


4.5.92
======
- Add xfconf_channel_new_with_property_base() to restrict a channel
  to a subset of the property tree.
- Add a dbus message filter to xfconfd that catches dbus daemon
  disconnect signals and flushes channels before xfconfd gets
  killed (bug 4487).
- Change libxfconf GObject bindings API slightly to use gulong IDs
  for each binding to be used when removing bindings.  Extend the
  unbind functions a bit.
- Bump libxfconf interface version due to incompatible change.
- Add libxfconf perl bindings.
- Remove xfconf_channel_remove_property() and
  xfconf_channel_remove_properties().
- Only treat the XML file under $XDG_CONFIG_HOME as a "user" file,
  and treat all others as system files.  This fixes the problem where
  Xfce-installed defaults get read *after* the user's config when
  Xfce is installed to a user-writable prefix (bug 4592).
- Fix build on Cygwin and other platforms that actually care about
  library link order (bug 4559).


4.5.91
======
- Remove xfsettingsd (moved to xfce4-settings package).  This removes
  xfconf's gtk+ dependency entirely.
- Add xfconf_channel_get() which returns an XfconfChannel singleton
  object that lives until calling xfconf_shutdown().
- Add xfconf_channel_reset_property(), which is a replacement for the
  'remove' functions.  This more accurately describes what 'remove'
  actually does in the presence of locked properties and/or properties
  that have system-wide defaults.
- Deprecate xfconf_channel_remove_property() and
  xfconf_channel_remove_properties().
- Change D-Bus interface to reflect above two changes.
- Add IsPropertyLocked() to the D-Bus interface, as well as a
  corresponding xfconf_channel_is_property_locked() libxfconf function,
  which allows clients to query whether or not a property can be
  modified.
- Don't send out a PropertyChange signal if a property is set to the
  value it already held.
- Fix daemon crash when resetting properties recursively.
- Fix daemon sending incorrect property names in the PropertyRemoved
  signal when removing multiple properties at once.
- For GObject property bindings, if the bound xfconf property is
  removed from the config store, try to reset the GObject property
  to the default value specified in its GParamSpec.
- Add -R option to xfconf-query which causes the -r option (reset) to
  operate recursively to include all properties under the specified
  property.
- Add -a option to xfconf-query which forces setting a property as an
  array even if the array only has one element.
- Fix xfconf_channel_get_property() so it properly converts the value
  fetched from the config store into the type that the caller
  requested (if any).


4.5.90
======
- Initial release.  There are bugs, and the API and ABI are not frozen.
