Xfconf - Perl interface to the Xfconf configuration system.

  use Xfce4::Xfconf;
  
  my $channel = Xfce4::Xfconf::Channel->new('FooChannel');

=head1 ABSTRACT

Perl bindings to the Xfconf confgiuration system.  This module allows
you to access settings stored in Xfconf using perl.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Xfce4::Xfconf module allows perl developers to make use of the
Xfconf configuration system to store and retrieve settings for perl
applications.  Learn more about Xfce and Xfconf at http://xfce.org/.

The Xfconf API reference is very useful when writing apps using xfconf-perl.
The call signatures will not always be identical, but one can get a good idea
of what the different functions and classes do:
http://mocha.xfce.org/~kelnos/xfconf/docs-current/

To discuss xfconf-perl, please join the Xfce Development Discussion list.
Instructions can be found at http://foo-projects.org/mailman/listinfo/xfce4-dev
